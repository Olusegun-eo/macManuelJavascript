    <h1>Async And Await: these are newly built-in functions used in making request to Network Apis</h1>
    <p>What Asyn and Await basically does is to allow us to chain multiple Request Together</p>
    <h5>How to Use Async and Await</h5>
    <p>
        Firstly, we create a Function, then we add async infront of Ordinary Func...thereby turning it into Async Func.  AND whenever we call this function, it will always return a promise regarless of what is inside it
        const getToDo = async (req, res) =>{
        }
        e.g 
        const test = getToDo()
        console.log(test)==>if you return this will give you a Promise
