    <h1>How To make Promises</h1>
    <p>A promise is that I am goin to do something and I will either get resolved or reject</p>
    <p>
        it is about having a function that getSomething = ()=>{
            ....that has some kind of NetWork request, Like we've been doing
            ...It will take in Some Data That will take some time to do
            ...A promise return new Promise() that will lead one or two outcomes
            ...A promise will be resolved i.e we get the data AND it resolved
            ...Or We get error and It is rejected. 
            Promise takes-in 2 params wich are also built-in js param called(resolved, reject
            return new Promise( (resolve , reject) =>{
                //WE do smthg e.g Fetch data
                If we get some data back, We call resolve(and pass data inside it)
            })
        }
        If we get apromise(data) back And we call getSomething(), Then we tack on
        .then( ()=>()--->A promise is saying I will fire this func wen we resolved promise)
        this func takes-in the data we resolved. We add the second func to if get error a reject in the same way
        .then( ()=>{
            console.log(data, "the func fired")
        }, (err)=>{
            console.log(err)
        })


        <h1>A better wayq to Handle promise and its params</h1>
        <p>
            getSomething().then( (data)=>{
                console.log(data)
            }).catch( (err)=>{
                console.log(err)
            })
        </p>
